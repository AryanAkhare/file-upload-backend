PROJECT TITLE:
Image & Video Upload Backend Application

GOAL:
The main goal of this project is to build a backend system that allows users to upload
images and videos, store them securely using Cloudinary or local storage, save file
details in a database, and notify users via email after a successful upload.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This backend application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It handles multipart file uploads, supports both images and videos, and integrates
third-party services like Cloudinary for cloud storage and Nodemailer for email
notifications.

KEY FEATURES:
- Upload images and videos from client to server
- Store media files on Cloudinary
- Optional local file storage on server
- Save file metadata (name, type, URL, email) in MongoDB
- Send confirmation email after successful upload
- Clean MVC-based folder structure

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Cloudinary (media storage)
- Nodemailer (email service)
- express-fileupload (file handling)
- dotenv (environment variables)

BACKEND FLOW:
Client sends file (multipart/form-data)
→ Express server receives request
→ Middleware processes file
→ Controller uploads file to Cloudinary or local storage
→ File details saved in MongoDB
→ Confirmation email sent to user

USE CASE:
This project can be used as:
- Media upload service
- Backend for social media apps
- Learning project for file handling and cloud integration
- Base for scalable media applications

END GOAL:
To understand real-world backend concepts such as file uploads, cloud storage,
database integration, and email notifications in a structured and production-ready way.
